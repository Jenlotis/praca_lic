# praca_lic - my bachelor's degree script

creating as universal as possible tool to automaticly process and assembly mtDNA seqences from whole NGS seqence using Trochulus snails seqences as base

idea: having as many programs as possible in the repository so user can just unpack and run(from some packages I use just one script), alternative: chcecking an downloading all apps from bash
